        <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>I'm a UI/UX designer and developer working as a Lead Designer for a small software company called <a class="semcat" href="http://semcat.net/">SEMCAT</a>.  We develop software for independent insurance agents that enables agents to obtain accurate insurance quotes for thier customers.</p>
          <p>I grew up surrounded by people who looked at the world differently - architects, artists and photographers - and growing up around those that designed, created and manipulated space for work or pleasure opened my eyes to the power of design. My initial path led me to architecture â€“ architectural design does not simply draft shelter but rather creates the framework in which individuals, families, and communities come together to build lives, relationships, ideas, or companies. In addition to architecture, I was drawn to photography as a photographer employs a very deliberate perspective within a confined space to share an idea, elicit an emotion or create beauty. Eventually I moved on to web design to expand my horizons to yet another medium.  To me, designing for the virtual world is simply another medium in which to employ these techniques, and in fact the process is exactly the same, with the only difference being the form of the final output.</p>
          <p>Spatial design, whether actual or virtual, crosses the boundaries between a person's physical, mental and emotional realms. How we navigate the world in which we live, work and play is not random; our spaces are created and constructed by designers intent on bringing efficiency, efficacy and beauty together for an elevated experience. Creating spaces that are not only practical and accessible but also welcoming drives me to push expected boundaries... to introduce something unique and beautiful...to make someone's experience with the world around beautiful and better.</p>

          <h2>More About Me</h2>
            <p>I'm a huge fan of sports and played tennis in high school and a little in college.  My father grew up in Germany and brought back a love for all things cycling.  I was one of the only kids who knew or cared what the Tour de France was.  After college I began to ride more seriously and race.  I own and manage an amatuer regional cycling team with one of my really good friends called Flatwater Cycling.  8 yeags ago I started ice skating and playing hockey in a local adult league.  It is one of the greatest sports on the face of the earth.</p>
            <p>Not sure I have a dream job just want to work with poeple who love design, appreciate the importance of design and doing great things.  But I would love to do design, UI/UX, iOS dev and front end.  That's not too much is it?  People might ask me why I want to do both the design and development.  It's very much like the work I did while in the architectural field.  You'd design buildings and structures but you'd also do all the drawings for how the building is built (or in the case of small architectural projects, build it yourself - very much like wearing your dev hat).</p>
